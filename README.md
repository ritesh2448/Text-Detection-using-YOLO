# Text-Detection-And-Recognition

## Preprocessing
#### ICDAR dataset was used consisting of 461 images : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ObrV9pbH_-LBGbIodWgB6W4dtQloTTH6/view
#### In-consistent File names were corrected 
#### Images and ground truth annotations were preprocessed and normalized as specified in : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf

## Text-Detection
#### Single class custom YOLO model was built for detecting text in images using tensorflow and keras
#### Predictions of the model were interpreted and bounding boxes were filtered using non max suppression
